value_prompt = '''Evaluate if given numbers can obtain 24 (sure/likely/impossible)
Attention:
Only use the input numbers to obtain 24, using basic arithmetic operations (+ - * /).
All numbers must be used exactly once.
Use as little combinations as necessary. When you find a valid way to get 24, stop further exploration.
For each attempted combination, provide natural language reasoning (explain your thought process step-by-step) before deciding whether to continue or conclude.
Do not enumerate every possible combination; only show the attempts that lead you toward the solution.
If you find a way to get 24, output the complete combination in one expression on the last second line using the exact format \(6 + 6 + 12 = 24\) where all numbers and operations are enclosed in ().
On the last line, output the final evaluation result exactly in the format \boxed{{\text{{eval value}}}}. Do not output the boxed answer more than once. The braces must be curly brackets.
If you can obtain 24, the eval value should be sure; if you can't, the eval value should be impossible, if you are not sure, the eval value should be likely. Do not use other eval value.

Attention:
Please compute both sides of the math expression in the giving expression. If they are all equal, mark this condition is 'Sure!'; otherwise, 'Wrong!'.
Also check whether the numbers in expression were come from the result of the operations in input or not. If they are correct to combine to obtain 24, mark this condition is 'Sure!'; otherwise, 'Wrong!'.
Two conditions are all satisfied, output 'Sure!'; otherwise, output 'Wrong!'.
