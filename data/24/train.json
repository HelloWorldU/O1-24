"<|begin_of_thought|>\n\nSo, I've got this question：Given 4 numbers [3, 7, 10, 13], using add, subtract, multiply, and divide (each number can only be used once, and parentheses can be used to change the order of operations) so that the final result is 24.Let me think carefully, the rule is We can only use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).And it seems like that we can't modify individual numbers (like making them negative directly).Each number must be used exactly once.The final result must be exactly 24 (not -24).Ok, l should be careful, let me solve this 24 Game problem using the A* search algorithm. \n\nInitial numbers: [3, 7, 10, 13]\n\nThe A* algorithm will help us find the optimal solution by:\n1. Using a heuristic function to estimate how close we are to 24\n2. Maintaining a priority queue to explore most promising paths first\n3. Keeping track of visited states to avoid cycles\n\nSearch Process:\n[Selected failed attempt with analysis]\n\nSelected Failed Attempt:\nCHOSE: \\(3*13\\) → \\([7, 10, 39]\\)\nTRY: \\(7-39=-32.00\\)\nREST: \\([-32, 10]\\)\n\nAnalysis:\n- Why this path failed: The result of \\(7-39\\) is \\(-32\\), which is too far from 24.\n- Mathematical constraints that prevented success: The subtraction led to a negative number, making it impossible to reach 24 with the remaining numbers.\n- Lessons learned: Avoid operations that result in large negative numbers early in the process.\n\nFind the solution!\n[Successful solution path]\n\nTry: \\(3*10=30.00\\), Rest: \\([7, 13, 30]\\)\nChose: \\(3*10 = 30.00\\) → \\([7, 13, 30]\\)\nTry: \\(7-13=-6.00\\), Rest: \\([-6, 30]\\)\nChose: \\(7-13 = -6.00\\) → \\([-6, 30]\\)\nTry: \\(-6+30=24.00\\), Rest: \\([24]\\)\nFinal expression: \\((7-13)+(3*10)=24\\)\n<|end_of_thought|>\n\n<|begin_of_solution|>\n\n\\[ \\boxed{(7-13)+(3*10) = 24} \\]\nLet me explain how we found this solution:\n\n1. Initial Setup:\n   - Starting numbers: [3, 7, 10, 13]\n   - Target value: 24\n   - Available operations: +, -, *, /\n   - Each number must be used exactly once\n\n2. Search Strategy:\n   - Implemented A* search algorithm\n   - Used heuristic function h(n) = |24 - current_value|\n   - Maintained priority queue for optimal path exploration\n   - Tracked visited states to prevent cycles\n\n3. Solution Path:\n   Try: \\(3*10=30.00\\), Rest: \\([7, 13, 30]\\)\n   Chose: \\(3*10 = 30.00\\) → \\([7, 13, 30]\\)\n   Try: \\(7-13=-6.00\\), Rest: \\([-6, 30]\\)\n   Chose: \\(7-13 = -6.00\\) → \\([-6, 30]\\)\n   Try: \\(-6+30=24.00\\), Rest: \\([24]\\)\n\n4. Final Result:\n   We successfully found that \\((7-13)+(3*10) = 24\\)\n   This solution is optimal as it uses the minimum necessary operations.<|end_of_solution|>"
