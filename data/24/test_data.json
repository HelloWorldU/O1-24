        "explanation": "Let me explain how we found this solution:\n\n1. Initial Setup:\n   - Starting numbers: [2, 13, 13, 13]\n   - Target value: 24\n   - Available operations: +, -, *, /\n   - Each number must be used exactly once\n\n2. Search Strategy:\n   - Implemented A* search algorithm\n   - Used heuristic function h(n) = |24 - current_value|\n   - Maintained priority queue for optimal path exploration\n   - Tracked visited states to prevent cycles\n\n3. Solution Path:\n   Try:13/13=1.00,Rest:[1.0, 2, 13]\n   Chose:(13/13) = 1.00 → [1.0, 2, 13]\n   Try:13-1.0=12.00,Rest:[2, 12.0]\n   Chose:(13-1.0) = 12.00 → [2, 12.0]\n   Try:2*12.0=24.00,Rest:[24.0]\n\n4. Final Result:\n   We successfully found that 2*(13-(13/13)) = 24\n   This solution is optimal as it uses the minimum necessary operations.",
